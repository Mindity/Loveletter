# Loveletter

*A encrypted messaging server, used in JournWorks Chat*
Loveletter is our in house encrypted messaging server/protocol, that we built for JournWorks's Chat feature.
It supports calling, private messaging and group role manageable messaging.
# How to build

## Prerequisites

[Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) | As it's the main programing language being used, we of course need it to run Love letter.

**LL suported client** | To make sure Loveletter is able to be interfaced using the client API, we need a client to test and run Loveletter. Like Loveact.

## Time to build

``git clone https://github.com/Mindity/loveletter.git
cd loveletter
cargo build
cargo run``

And your all set!
